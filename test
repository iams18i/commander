# PoC - Real-Time Behavioral Intelligence Layer for E-commerce using ClickHouse

Create a real-time analytics layer that ingests and analyzes user behavioral data (clicks, views, add-to-cart, purchases) from an e-commerce platform using ClickHouse. This data will be used to power: - Real-time dashboards (internal stakeholders) - Customer behavior segments (marketing/product teams) - Smart triggers (e.g., abandoned cart reminders, trend-based recommendations) - Operational alerts (e.g., sudden spike/drop in product interest)

## Components in Scope

Event Stream Ingestion
Track events like page view, click, add-to-cart. Optionally, use Kafka or simple HTTP collector.

ClickHouse Setup
Create schema (e.g., wide tables) for fast queries. Time-series focused structure with partitions and materialized views.

Dashboards
Example dashboard with metrics like funnel drop-off, product views, peak hours. Grafana or Superset.

Behavior Segmentation
Precompute segments like “high cart abandoners”, “recently active users”, “promo sensitive users”.

Trigger System (optional)
Generate alerts or send events to 3rd-party (email, Slack, etc.) when real-time rules match (e.g., trend spikes).

ML Extension (stretch goal)
Store features for real-time recommendation or personalized sorting.

## Use Cases Demonstrated

Real-time dashboard
“Top viewed products this hour”

Funnel breakdown
“Cart-to-checkout conversion by category”

Behavioral segments
“Users who viewed >5 products in last 24h but didn’t purchase”

Alerts
“Send Slack alert if cart abandonment spikes 20% in an hour”

Deliverables - clickable storefront - Working ClickHouse instance with example data - Basic dashboard (time series + funnel + segment views) - Event stream prototype (collector + sample ingestion) - Demo script + screenshots - Documentation with schema, queries, outcomes
